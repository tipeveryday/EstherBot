    "HOW DOES THAT WORK?": "Authenticity is the degree to which you are true to your own personality, spirit, or character, despite external pressures.\nThose very external pressures often make it uncomfortable to be the authentic 'you'\nThe largest barrier to finding authenticity are the proverbial crutches we lean on to create our sense of identity.\nWhen you begin to kick out the crutches your safety net vanishes from under you and discomfort settles in. This discomfort may seem unbearable at first but as you remain there it slowly becomes more comfortable",
