    "CHILDHOOD": "It's an interesting but complicated story.\nShe grew up in California and Oregon. Technically she's the youngest of 10 siblings but most of her childhood was spent living as an only kid with her mom. Btw if you ever want to chat about something else, just say 'more'. %[I want more details](postback:childhood_family)",
    "I WANT MORE DETAILS": "Her parents dated briefly but they split up before she was born.\nHer mom Patricia was recently divorced with 2 kids, and her dad Jim was a recent widower with 5 kids.\nPatricia getting pregnant was definitely not in the plan!\n%[What happened next?](postback:childhood_patricia_move)",
    "WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?": "After finding out she was pregnant Patricia felt like she needed help so she moved in with her mom. As a result, Esther's grandma played an important role in raising her.\n![grandma](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esthercrawford/smooch-bot-example/master/img/Screenshot%202016-04-27%2003.06.53.png)\n %[Where was Jim?](postback:childhood_what_jim)",
    "WHERE WAS JIM?": "Jim mostly faded away. He occasionally sent letters but he never told anyone about the baby.\nEsther was a secret he hid from everyone, even his other kids, until Esther was 8 years old. %[Whoa! Who told?](postback:childhood_jim_secret)",
    "WHOA! WHO TOLD?": "Esther knew Jim's full name so when she was 7 years old she called information and got his phone number.\nA teenage girl picked up the phone.\nEsther asked, 'Is Jim there?'. The teenager said, 'No - he's at work. Who is this?'\nNot totally understanding the ramifications, Esther said, 'This is his daughter Esther!'\nThe teenager turned out to be her sister Diana, and with that, the secret was out. %[Were people shocked?](postback:childhood_reaction)",
    "WERE PEOPLE SHOCKED?": "Oh man! It was tough. Not everyone took the news well but it led to Esther meeting her dad the next year.\n![dad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esthercrawford/smooch-bot-example/master/img/Screenshot%202016-04-27%2003.07.06.png)\n %[And her siblings?](postback:childhood_meet_siblings)",
    "AND HER SIBLINGS?": "It took some time but eventually she met Jim's other kids who were already in high school and beyond.\nShe always felt like an outsider in his family but the silver lining of a challenging childhood is it taught strength and independence.\nThe desire for belonging is likely what led her onto the internet at a young age - there she found friends and connection. It was the 90's so she put up with dial tones and slow modems to access the web, but it paid off in big ways.\nShe learned the basics of web development and design by tinkering, browsing, and chatting. %[What motivated her?](postback:childhood_education)",
    "WHAT MOTIVATED HER?": "Well... Patricia never really got it together. She relied on welfare, food stamps, and housing programs for many years.\nEsther saw how limited her mom's options were and vowed to never be that way. Educating herself was the key to getting out of poverty. %[On to college!](postback:education)",
    "EDUCATION": "She always had a strong internal drive to succeed and make her own way in the world.\nAcademics came fairly easily so in college she challenged herself by learning Arabic and spending a year in the Middle East. %[Degrees](postback:education_degrees) %[Why Arabic?!](postback:education_arabic) %[Living abroad](postback:education_middle_east)",
    "WHY ARABIC?!": "9/11 happened while she was a freshman in college. While watching all the commentary and news she realized how everything she was told about Arabs and Muslims came through a filter of some kind...\nOut of curiosity she decided to learn the language and try to understand the culture.\nIt took a few years but ultimately she became conversational and literate.\n![arabic](https://github.com/esthercrawford/smooch-bot-example/blob/master/img/arabiclanguage2.jpg)\n %[Nice work!](postback:education_middle_east)",
    "LIVING ABROAD": "![jordan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esthercrawford/smooch-bot-example/master/img/jordan.jpg)\nEsther lived in Amman, Jordan in 2004-2005 during the height of the Iraq War.\nThat proximity gave her a unique vantage point and opportunity to see the power of publicity, narrative, and social proof on the geopolitical stage. %[How so?](postback:education_how) %[What's Jordan like?](postback:education_jordan)",
    "NICE WORK!": "Oh, it was! Esther lived in Amman, Jordan in 2004-2005 during the height of the Iraq War.\nThat proximity gave her a unique vantage point and opportunity to see the power of publicity, narrative, and social proof on the geopolitical stage. %[How so?](postback:education_how) %[Tell me more about Jordan](postback:education_jordan) %[I like crazy travel stories](postback:education_travel)",
    "HOW SO?": "Well... let's just say the on-the-ground reality often looks different than what's portrayed in the media.\nIt turns out war requires a ton of masterful marketing to sell.\nWhile traveling around the region she visited refugee camps and learned the value of active listening.\nIt turns out being an empathetic listener is an invaluable and undevervalued skill. %[Makes sense](postback:education_degrees)",
    "WHAT'S JORDAN LIKE?": "I'm glad you asked!\nIt's a beautiful country located in a difficult neighborhood. Can you imagine being sandwiched between so many volatile conflicts?! %[Sounds rough](postback:education_rough)",

    "PATH TO MARKETING": "Yep. It definitely wasn’t a linear path to Product Marketing.\nShe got her undergrad in Philosophy and then got a graduate degree in International Relations.\nThroughout school she also maintained a popular blog – writing about life, travel, and politics. %[Why Philosophy?](postback:career_startups) %[Why International Relations?](postback:career_startups)",
    "WHY PHILOSOPHY?": "![philosophy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esthercrawford/smooch-bot-example/master/img/alanwatts.png)\nA lot of people joke that a Philosophy degree is worthless, but actually, it taught her valuable skills like how to write, think critically, and follow an argument.\nIt turns out most people jump to conclusions instead of challenging underlying assumptions and beliefs.",
    "DEGREES": "Yep. It definitely wasn’t a linear path to Product Marketing.\nShe got her undergrad in Philosophy and then got a graduate degree in International Relations.\nThroughout school she also maintained a popular blog – writing about life, travel, and politics.",
    "CAREER": "Esther has 9 years of marketing experience and is passionate about storytelling and design.\nThe first 5 years were spent as a social marketing consultant for big brands.\nHer campaigns even won some awards for innovation in digital marketing.\nThen she got the itch to build her own product so she moved to San Francisco and cofounded Glmps, a 7 second video app.\nFor the past few years she's helped launch and grow other startups.\nWhat do you want to know more about? %[The big brands](postback:career_bigbrands) %[The startups](postback:career_startups)",
    "THE BIG BRANDS": "Ok.
